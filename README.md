# SemEval2018
This final course project for the graduate neural networks (INFO 557) course was a part of an in-class competition. This project performs sentiment analysis of tweets and is a part of the SemEval-2018 task.

The network architecture uses an emsembling of stacked, bidirectional GRUs to make predictions of emotions in tweets.
